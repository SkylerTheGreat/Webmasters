					<!-- Clean Energy --> 
						Eco-friendly building materials are environmentally safe, easily recyclable, and don't harm the environment during production, use, or disposal. They offer long-term benefits, including reduced carbon emissions, energy saving, and lower utility bills when used in green homes. A minimum of 50% of customers can choose to buy renewable electricity directly from their energy provider, while everyone has the opportunity to acquire renewable energy certificates.
