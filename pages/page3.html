					We are at a time in history where our world is becoming aware of our environment and how to sustain it. There are multiple ways to make changes to help our environment.
					Some are small and can be done right at home. While others are large, if everyone makes a small change it will have a large effect.
				</p>

					To live in a more eco friendly world we must reduce what we use. Electricity for example is an area we can make changes to save energy. 
					We can use solar power to turn on rechargeable lights instead of using fossil fuels. This will help us cut back on carbon emissions too. 
					Small changes like turning off a light in an empty room or during the daytime and unplugging unused appliances will make a big impact.

					Fixing a dripping faucet and installing a water flow device on a shower can help conserve water. Water conservation is so important.
					Small changes can save gallons. Taking shorter showers, using water efficient washers, and being proactive on fixing and leaks are great ways to live eco friendly. 
				</p>

					Our landfills are so full. Often with bad materials like glass and plastic. We need to use more biodegradable substances. 
					Also recycling products like paper, glass and plastic is better for the earth than putting them in a landfill.  
					Recycling organic matter such as egg shells is way better for the earth and the soil. 
				</p>
				<p id = "words">
					Transportation is vital for most people.  However it is one of the largest forms of carbon emissions. 
					If everyone made small changes like riding a bike when possible or using public transportation it would make a large dent in our carbon footprint. 
					Driving electric cars or carpooling is another example of how to conserve energy and cut emissions. 
				</p>
				<p id = "second">
					Making eco conscious choices can also benefit our health.  Plastic containers don't always end up recycled but in landfills. 
					Look for merchandise that's in as little packaging as possible and made from recycled materials to help our environment.
				</p>
				<p id = "words">
					Making changes to how we live can save our world for generations to come. 
					Changes like biking are good for our health and environment and possible for most of us to do. 
					Our choices at the store make a huge impact on our future suitability.  
					Just using less  resources like water and fossil fuels can make our world greener.
