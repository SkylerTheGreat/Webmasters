						Our country currently has growing worries about our environment and rightly so. To help our nation The U.S. Department of Energy is 
					finding new and transformative methods of cleaner energy and energy-efficient practices. Cleaner energy sources will lead to overall 
					better health and fewer safety risks.
				<br />
				<p>
					Renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydropower offer an alternative to fossil fuels. These alternative sources leave a much smaller footprint on the earth.
					By cutting back harmful emissions susch as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, clean energy plays a huge in respiratory health. Cleaner air or illnesses such as asthma, 
					allergies and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are good.
