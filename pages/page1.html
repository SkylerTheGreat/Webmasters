				<p id = "words">
						Our country currently has growing worries about our environment and rightly so. To help our nation The U.S. Department of Energy is 
					finding new and transformative methods of cleaner energy and energy-efficient practices. Cleaner energy sources will lead to overall 
					better health and fewer safety risks.
				</p>
				<p id="words">
					Renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydropower offer an alternative to fossil fuels. These alternative sources leave a much smaller footprint on the earth.
					By cutting back harmful emissions such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, clean energy plays a huge role in respiratory health. Cleaner air or illnesses such as asthma, 
					allergies and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are good.
				</p>
				<p id="words">
					 Climate change is a growing threat to our world. Moving towards clean energy will help with public health and safety. Lowering or eliminating greenhouse gas emissions and 
					 curbing extreme weather events. That will make communities more resilient and help preserve lives and livelihoods.
				</p>
				<p id="words">
					 Clean energy solutions and energy efficiency are quickly becoming the cornerstone of sustainable development. By optimizing energy use people will see lower utility bills.
					 Improving a building's insulation, and upgrading appliances to high energy efficiency are steps that can be taken to both help energy promote economic savings.
				</p>
				<p id="words">
					Clean Energy is crucial for everyone around the world. A more sustainable future and resilient earth. This however will require a global commitment. Innovation, collaboration,
					and investment in clean energy infrastructure can open a new door to better health and safety for everyone worldwide.
				</p>
				<p id="words">
					A healthier, safer, and cleaner world for generations to come is a world investment. Everyone will have a role from turning off
					a light that's not being used to developing a new way to use renewable energy. The call for all to help is clear. We have a brighter future at hand.
