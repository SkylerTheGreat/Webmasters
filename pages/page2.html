				<p id = "words">
					Moving towards a sustainable energy future will require multiple approaches. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) 
					recently reported that it's going to require multiple energy styles working together to reduce carbon emissions.
				</p>
				<p id = "words">
					Currently the world's progress is not growing towards reducing carbon emissions as fast as it is increasing in usage. A larger
					use of electric vehicles and renewable heating sources would be two major starts towards reducing our carbon footprint.
				</p>
				<p id = "words">
					There will be challenges world wide towards a more sustainable life. Moving forward, countries will need to provide initiatives
					such as energy improvement projects. Electrification of countries worldwide will require nations to work together. 
				</p>
				<p id = "words">
					In order to achieve world wide success there will have to be regulations and guidelines. Timelines will need to be set in
					order to move a carbonless future that will need to be agreed.
				</p>
				<p id = "words">
					New innovation and discoveries from renewable sources like solar and wind will help lower the cost of renewable energy cars,
					 heating units, homes and factory buildings. Lower costs are influential in people moving towards a lower carbon footprint. As 
					technology advances the amount of electric vehicles will increase.
				</p>
				<p id = "words">
					World wide the overall lower carbon footprint will make a huge change to the environment, society and our financial system. 
					All of this is possible with renewable energy that's efficient too. Time is of the essence in order to have a strong sustainable
					future.
